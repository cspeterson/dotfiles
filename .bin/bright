  Increase or decrease screen brightness at hardware level by steps of 10% of
  max, as determined by the values under /sys/class/backlight/**. Limit values
  to the range of 0 to max_brightness.

    up      | Increase brightness by 10%
    down    | Decrease brightness by 10%
    current | Report current brightness
