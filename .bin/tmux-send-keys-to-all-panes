This script sends its separate arguments along to \`tmux send-keys\` for the
current Tmux session.
As per Tmux docs, "if the string is not recognised as a key, it is sent as a
series of characters."

This script will not function outside of an existing tmux session.

Usage:
  # To send arbitary normal keys
  $(basename "${0}") "abcdefg"

  # To use non-alphanum keys, e.g. to quit Vim by sending a literal CR,
  # separate it as its own argument
  $(basename "${0}") ":qa" 'Enter'

  exit 1
